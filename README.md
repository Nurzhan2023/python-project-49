## Description

This project includes a collection of 5 math-related games designed to challenge and improve your arithmetic and logical thinking skills. The games include:

- Checking if a number is prime
- Inserting a number into an arithmetic progression
- Providing the result of a calculation (multiplication, addition, subtraction)
- Answering if a number is even
- Finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers

## Installation

To install the games, ensure you have Poetry installed on your machine, then run the following commands:

```bash
make install

##Games
